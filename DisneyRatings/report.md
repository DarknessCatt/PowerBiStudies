This is a simple report and analysis of the information acquired using PowerBi.

First of all, the ratings count and the average rating per month per branch (California, Hong Kong and Paris) were studied. Initial observations were:

* As expected, Disneyland California has the highest rating and number of reviews.
* There was a sharp increase (about 500) in the number of reviews for Disneyland Paris on October, as well as the second worst rating for the year.
* As well a sharp drop in ratings for Disneyland Hong Kong also in October (from steady ~4.2 to ~3.9).

These changes on october were really insteresting. Were they related to COVID somehow? The review data, with month and branch, was placed on the dashboard. Selecting a specific point in the graphs, the reviews were filtered to show only those related to a certain month and branch.

* For Hong Kong, the reviews mainly criticized that it was crowded and hot (because of the summer). It seems the tourists were also quite uneducated, skipping lines and pushing others.
* The reviews didn't change much for Paris, focusing on waiting times and prices.

So, not much information here and doesn't explain clearly the increase in reviews and drop in ratings. During a quick search around the web, it seems both parks would close after october because of COVID. So my best guess is: 

* Since it was possible the park would be closed for the rest of the year, a large number of tourists visited the parks.
* (Maybe due to bad management), the parks were crowded, increasing waiting times and so on.
* Also, since a lot of people went to the park, a lot of reviews were made.

More examination would be necessary in order to conclude anything. It would also be nice to have pre-COVID data and compare it to the current data.
